DAILY PLANNER – UI DESIGN PROMPT (NO CODE)
Design a peaceful, minimal daily planner web app UI focused on calm productivity and long-term consistency.
Overall Feel
Quiet, distraction-free, and soothing
Feels like Notion, Apple Health, or a mindfulness app
Designed for daily use without visual fatigue

Color & Mood
Soft light background (off-white or very light grey)
White cards with subtle shadows
Muted accent colors (soft blue, sage green, warm grey)
No neon colors, no bright contrasts
No gradients or flashy effects

Typography
Clean, modern sans-serif font
Medium font weight
Plenty of spacing between elements
Text should feel breathable and calm

Dashboard Page (Home)
Grid layout (not a list)
Each task shown as a card
Cards contain:
Simple icon (emoji or minimal symbol)
Task name
Subtle status text (e.g., “Completed today” or “Not done yet”)
Cards have rounded corners and gentle hover elevation
No loud animations
Tasks to display:

Simple back navigation

Gym Page
Clean sections with soft card containers
Push-Ups Section:
Title: “Push Ups – Target 100”
Multiple number input fields

Interaction Style
No pop-ups
No alerts
Feedback shown as calm text
Everything should feel gentle and intentional

Goal of the UI
The interface should feel like a daily ritual, not a productivity dashboard. Something the user wants to open every day quietly and consistently. The app should be opened by log-In page as single user by username and password as   User -> Sakthi
Pass-> Sakthi@123  The Page Loader Icon should be First letter of the Daily-planner which D. A ‘D’ Symbol should the loading icon.  It should be a full react project.
